Password Generator

This is a simple password generator that generates a random password and stores it in a txt file.

Usage

To use the password generator, simply run the PasswordGenerator.java file using the command line or an IDE. You will be prompted to enter the length of the password you want to generate.

Once you enter the length of the password, the program will generate a random password that contains both letters and numbers. The password will be printed to the console, and also stored in a file named password.txt.

Security

This password generator uses a cryptographically secure random number generator to ensure that the generated passwords are truly random and not predictable. However, it is still recommended that you do not use the same password for multiple accounts, and that you change your passwords regularly.
